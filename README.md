## Two arm biofeedback study

## Background

This study compares a control group with a training group on two virtual reality
games aiming at teaching participants a breathing technique and subsequently to apply
this technique to a stressful environment 


### Study Design

Both groups came in over two sessions. In the first session both groups took a baseline 
physiological measurement (seated at rest) and then went on to a virtual reality stressor (horror) experience. Then the training groups did two sessions of the slow breathing training.

In the second session, training group participants did two more sessions of the slow breathing 
training. Both groups then took part in the biofeedback stressor, which asked them to control their
breathing to keep their heart rate low to avoid detection by a monster. 

The physiological measurements reported here are Heart Rate (HR), heart
rate variability as indexed by SDNN, and respiration rate (resp).

Initial analysis was conducted using a paired t-test for the HR and SDNN
difference from baseline to the biofeedback stressor.
